for application
to the ground and excited states of moleculesmassively-parallel, reduced-scaling
many-body methods for application to the ground and excited states of
molecules. This goal can be approached from many different directions,
using many different techniques, but the particular technique that we have
chosen to explore herein is that of pair natural orbitals (PNOs). PNOs
provide a convenient means of truncating the size of the orbital space
in which electron correlation must be computed, allowing one to compute
the correlation energy in the truncated space to arbitrary accuracy relative
to the value of the correlation energy computed using all orbitals.
Oftentimes, a significant reduction in computational cost can be achieved
at the expense of just a modest reduction in accuracy. More importantly, however,
the size of the orbital space corresponding to each pair of orbitals is
essentially independent of system size.
